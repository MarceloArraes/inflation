# Based on this prompt:
``` I want to make a website in the style of the pudding.cool projects that i like very much. I need your help doing the script for it. And planning the looks of the website. The idea I have is to question the inflation. I will start by saying something like: "They say that inflation is the measure of the amount the prices raise. But in reality the inflation is basically the rise in the groceries. THe things that really matter for you are more often then not, not tracked. THings that you would need to have a good life, not just good meals on the weeks. HOusing, stock market prices, gold.
So first part is showing something about the inflation (showing what is composed of)
The second part is questioning this and saying that the inflation that people think has a dark deeper reality, that is not tracked. Show this in the prices of gold, housjing, stock market etc.
Then show that the salaries didn't increase in reality. Even though nominaly they have.
In the end I want to correlate the M3 (the graph of monetary emission of currency) and the real price hikes. I believe this is a better way to measure inflation, and then I finish by talking about the cantilion Effect. How the people closer to power benefit more from monetary emissions and how that reflects not in groceries hiking of prices but on real important valuables increase in price, like the houses, gold and stock market.
That makes sense for you? I want to make it as simple as possible but with a lot of interaction and animations. ```
